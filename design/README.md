# MFD Project Day - Countries website

![Design preview for the REST Countries API with color theme switcher coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## The challenge

Your challenge to create a Vue.js SPA that integrates with the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.eu) to pull country data and display the data as shown in the designs.

Desktop and Mobile designs are available. The website also needs to look good in-between (fluid responsive).

Your users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode 

## Where to find everything

All available designs are the `/design` folder.

Use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.

There is a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Building your project

Use the following technologies:
- BEM
- SCSS
- Semantic HTML
- Vue CLI, Vue.js
- Single Page App with routing
- Git Repo

## Hosting

Deploy to a static Web Server (e.g. netlify)

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
